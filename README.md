# Fuzzy-inference-system-for-controlling-the-movement-of-a-mobile-robot
The main task of this robot is to avoid various obstacles that may appear in front of it. The robot consists of several solid parts combined together in order to achieve the goal of this function, such as (a cart for movement and mobility, a sensor for measuring distance, motors for propulsion, a control panel, .....)


In order to clarify the mechanism of building the robot and the fuzzy reasoning system that controls it, we will follow the sequence of steps below:

1. Present the robot, its hardware components, and the environment in which it operates.
2. Describe the structure of the fuzzy reasoning system that controls the robot, along with a detailed explanation of each of its sections.
3. Explain the method used to program the reasoning engine and define its rules.
4. Analyze the results of applying the reasoning system to the robot by examining the different scenarios the robot may encounter during its navigation.
